# ConvCapsule-tensorflow
Implementation of convolutional capsule layers with tensorflow
The capsule idea is based on a recent paper from Prof. Hinton's team, "Dynamic Routing Between Capsules" 2017
arXiv:1710.09829v2 [cs.CV] 7 Nov 2017

In the initial version, the convolutional primary capsule layer without routing and convolutional capsule layer with dynamic routing are implemented. In following versions, transposed convolutional capsule layers will be implemented.
